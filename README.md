# ✈️ AI Flight Delay Predictor

This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a flight will be delayed based on features such as origin, destination, distance, and airline. It's built using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn.

## 🚀 Features

- Trains a Random Forest model to classify delayed flights
- Encodes categorical features like airport codes and airline names
- Outputs model accuracy
- Easy to extend with additional flight data

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter (optional for experimentation)

## 📊 Example Input

A sample dataset (`sample.csv`) might look like:

FlightNumber,Origin,Destination,Distance,Airline,Delayed
123,ORD,LAX,1744,United,1
456,LAX,ORD,1744,United,0
789,ORD,JFK,740,Delta,0
101,ATL,ORD,606,American,1

## 🔧 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
